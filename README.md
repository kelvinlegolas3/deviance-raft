# RAFT© Deviance World Development
A repository to Deviance RAFT© World

## Objectives
- To allow contributors to "host" the latest changes of the **Deviance** world. 
- Instead of having to wait for the main creator to launch the world, you can just get the latest save files of this repository and paste in your "World" folder. With that, you can launch RAFT© and host the Deviance world on your own.

## How?
1. Message me on discord if you would like to become a **contributor**. **Leonhardt#8582**
2. If you're already a contributor, clone the repository to your local by entering this command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/kelvinlegolas3/deviance-raft.git.
```
3. Get the latest changes by entering this command: 
```
git pull
```
4. Know your RAFT© World directory by simply launching the game and click "Load World" and then click "Open World Folder Path". 
5. **Delete** all save files inside your **RAFT© World directory Deviance folder**, if there's any, then go to your **local repository Deviance folder** and copy all of the save files to your **RAFT© World directory Deviance folder**.
6. Launch the game and you should be able to see the **Deviance** world in the World list with the **date time that mirrors closely to the commit date time in GitHub**.
7. From this point, you're now hosting the latest changes of the **Deviance** world. Any save game that you will make will create another save folder in your RAFT© Deviance world directory.
8. If you're about to logout, **don't forget to save**.
9. **Delete** all save files inside your **local repository Deviance folder** then go to your **RAFT© World directory Deviance folder** and copy all of the save files to your **local repository Deviance folder**. This is to make sure that there is only one **latest** folder.
10. Commit and push your changes by entering this command: 
```
git add -A
git commit -m "I deleted the whole base guys"
git push
```

## Branches
**master** - we can directly push our changes of the Deviance world to master branch. You may branch out if you want to start a world on your own.

**Recommended commit messages**:
- _"Sail moved to middle"_
- _"Snatched all the planks in Storage room"_
- _"Parked the Raft in an Island"_

## Reminders
Make sure that you're always pulling the changes of this repository before hosting and making any necessary changes.
