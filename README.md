# Deviance World Development
This repository allows contributors to get the latest changes in our Deviance world.

# Objectives
To allow contributors to "host" the latest changes of the Deviance world. 
Instead of having to wait for the main creator to launch the world, you can just get the latest save files in this repository and paste in your "World" folder.
That way, you can launch Raft and host it on your own.

# How?
1. Message me if you would like to become a contributor.
2. Clone the repository on your local: https://github.com/kelvinlegolas3/deviance-raft.git.
3. Get the latest changes by doing this command: git pull
4. Copy the whole "Deviance" folder and paste it in your Raft World directory (Sample Raft Directory: %UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Redbeet Interactive\Raft\User\User_76561198047186297\World
   or simply launch the game and click "Load World" and then click "Open World Folder Path"
5. Launch the game and you should be able to see the Deviance world in the World list with the date time that mirrors closely to the commit date time in GitHub.
6. From this point, you're now hosting the latest changes of the Deviance world. Any save game that you make will create another save folder in your Raft World directory.
7. If you're about to logout, don't forget to save. Go to your Raft World directory and copy all of the files to the repository.
8. Commit your changes by doing this command: git commit -am "I deleted the whole Raft guys"

# Branches
- **master** - we can directly push our changes of the Deviance Raft. You may branch out if you want to start a world on your own.

- Recommended commit messages:
    - Sail moved to middle
    - Snatched all the planks in Storage room
    - Parked the Raft in an Island

# Reminders
- Make sure that you're always pulling the changes (git pull) on this repository before hosting and making any necessary changes.
