# Deviance World Development
Deviance Raft World repository

## Objectives
- To allow contributors to "host" the latest changes of the Deviance world. 
- Instead of having to wait for the main creator to launch the world, you can just get the latest save files in this repository and paste in your "World" folder.
- That way, you can launch Raft and host it on your own.

## How?
1. Message me on discord if you would like to become a **contributor**. **Leonhardt#8582**
2. Clone the repository on your local: https://github.com/kelvinlegolas3/deviance-raft.git.
3. Get the latest changes by doing this command: 
```
git pull
```
4. Copy the whole **Deviance** folder and paste it in your **Raft World directory**
	-**Sample Raft Directory**: _ _"%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Redbeet Interactive\Raft\User\User_76561198047186297\World"_ _
   or simply launch the game and click "Load World" and then click "Open World Folder Path"
5. Launch the game and you should be able to see the **Deviance** world in the World list with the ***date time that mirrors closely to the commit date time in GitHub***.
6. From this point, you're now hosting the latest changes of the **Deviance** world. Any save game that you make will create another save folder in your Raft Deviance World directory.
7. If you're about to logout, **don't forget to save**. Go to your Raft World directory and copy all of the files to the repository.
8. Commit your changes by doing this command: 
```
git commit -am "I deleted the whole Raft guys"
```

## Branches
**master** - we can directly push our changes of the Deviance Raft. You may branch out if you want to start a world on your own.

**Recommended commit messages**:
    _ _"Sail moved to middle"_ _
    _ _"Snatched all the planks in Storage room"_ _
    _ _"Parked the Raft in an Island"_ _

## Reminders
Make sure that you're always pulling the changes (git pull) on this repository before hosting and making any necessary changes.
